2. Value types store actual data directly, reference types store a reference to data. Boxing is converting a value type to an object type, unboxing is converting back.

3. Managed resources are controlled by .NET runtime, unmanaged resources are not and require manual cleanup.

4. The Garbage Collector automatically frees memory that is no longer in use by the program, preventing memory leaks and improving application performance.

Controlling Flow and Converting Types

1. Dividing an int by 0 throws a DivideByZeroException.

2. Dividing a double by 0 results in Infinity or NaN (Not a Number).

3. When an int overflows, it wraps around to the minimum negative value.

4. x = y++ assigns the current value of y to x, then increments y; x = ++y increments y first, then assigns the new value to x.

5. 
- break: Exits the entire loop
- continue: Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next
- return: Exits the entire method containing the loop

6. The three parts are: initialization, condition, and iteration. Only the condition is required.

7. = is an assignment operator, == is a comparison operator that checks equality.

8. Yes, this statement compiles. It's an infinite loop.

9. The underscore _ represents the default case in a switch expression.

10. An object must implement the IEnumerable interface to be used with foreach.
